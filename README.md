This is a programm for temporary workers. It's specialiced for diffrent companys, so when u like to switch, it may could 
help you. The target is to watch the companys and how much money they give you (cause a company isn't trustable). The 
programm supports:
* Companys
   * Jobs
     * Weekends
     * Month-over-jobs
     * Charges
     * Set it to inactive
   * Credits taken from the company, when you worked and wont wait to the end of the month..
   * "Static charges" cause they normaly didn't change for a job (you just have it there or not)
   * loanSplits, means, what goes away, to gouverment, maybe holiday-money for you, or whatelse, but "notloan"
* Multilangual (at the moment english and german)
* Diffrent filtering options and Views
   * Overallview and Detailedview based on Companys
   * Calendarview
   * Livesearch [jobname, jobplace, jobleader, jobcomment, companyname]
   * Show inactive
* SingleView (if you just use 1 company.. more limited)
* Encryption by pycrypto (experimental, but should work, include changing of content, but needs restart!! and 
doesn't work for windows, when there's no pycrypto for python 3.. but just let it be like the lemon tree 
;)

<h3>Install in *buntu</h3>
open console and put in:
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4 python3 python3-crypto

download the programm as zip (and unzip it) or check it out by git. after that a click on start.sh 
should start it. when it doesnt start, try to mark it in file-settings as executable (console: chmod +x 
start.sh)

Try it out and do a feedback! It have to get better in many details, but basicly it works..
