This is a programm for temporary workers. It's specialiced for diffrent companys, so when u like to switch, it may could 
help you. The target is to watch the companys and how much money they give you (cause a company isn't trustable). The 
programm supports:
* Companys
   * Jobs
     * Weekends
     * Month-over-jobs
     * Charges
     * Set it to inactive
   * Credits taken from the company, when you worked and wont wait to the end of the month..
   * "Static charges" cause they normaly didn't change for a job (you just have it there or not)
   * loanSplits, means, what goes away, to gouverment, maybe holiday-money for you, or whatelse, but "notloan"

* Diffrent filtering options and Views
   * Overallview and Detailedview based on Companys
   * Calendarview
   * Livesearch [jobname, jobplace, jobleader, jobcomment, companyname]
   * Show inactive
Try it out and do a feedback! It have to get better in many details, but basicly it works..
